    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "#### This dataset led me to question, is attrition more prevalent among job positions that lacked a long-term working relationship with management?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The significant differences that are found in these three variables suggest that attrition maybe linked to how management valued a certain job position.  This could affect the quality of communication between management and employee, along with their performance level and overall morale.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### By definition, attrition can lead to a reduction in the workforce due to an employee retiring or quitting.  If it is ignored, it can negatively affect the competitivness of a company because of the potential loss of experience in a company's ranks, and the need to implement costly training programs to make up for the people that left.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A positive professional relationship between manager and employee will reduce attrition in a company.¶\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pick a company and divide its employees into two equal groups that will act as our two sample groups.  Each group should have atleast 1000 people, giving us an adequate sample size to generate normal data.  The persons in the two groups will be of similar age mix, gender mix, pay level, and education level.  The persons will also have the same marital status, which for the sake of our experiment should be single.  We will run the experiment for a period of three years, because from our dataset we can see that the average number of years a person stayed in a particular job role, before his/her position was lost to attrition was about three years.  But we will monitor attrition on a yearly basis within the three year time frame, and consider only those positions vacated by the employee's own choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In the first group (test group), we will task the managers to implement a web-based performance management software, such as Performance Culture, and have monthly review/development sessions with each employee.  For the initial three months, we will monitor the managers to make sure they are implementing Performance Culture software properly within their departments.  All employee computers in this group will have Performance Culture installed on them, so that employees and managers can use the developmental tools to monitor and develop each other's perfomance, and at the same time create a better professional relationship with each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### The second group (the control group) will not have Performance Culture implemented and instead will only have two annual reviews, one every six months.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variable of interest:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The variable of interest is the number of job positions lost due to attrition from each group after three years.  We will run a t-test calculation on the data of all the jobs vacated during the  three years from both groups, and use a p-value of .05 as our significance level, to measure how significant the difference in our two groups are.  If the p value is greater than .05, than we will reject our hypothesis that implementing a performance management software within an organization will help reduce attrition, and we will accept the null hypothesis that a positive professional relationship between manager and employee does not effect attrition in a company.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Secondary Metric:\n",
    "#### A secondary metric we can track, that will also give us insights, is the time it took to fill, or replace, the vacated job positions.\n",
